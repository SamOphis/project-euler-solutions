# Project Euler solutions

These are some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions, written in the [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) language. Each solution follows the naming scheme `px.cr` where `x` is the 3-digit problem number. An example would be `p001.cr`.

These solutions are by no means optimal. Please see other solutions if optimal performance is what you're after.
